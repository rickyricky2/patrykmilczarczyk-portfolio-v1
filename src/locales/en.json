    "description": "I am a 20 year old Computer Science student at the Lodz University of Technology, passionate about programming and technology.\nIn 2025, I graduated from the IT Technical School in Opoczno, awarded the Silver School 2024 title. There I gained solid knowledge of systems, databases, algorithms, and web development. I also joined a Python club, completed courses, and created my first projects. I was a finalist of the \"One Year Before the Diploma\" competition, passing a professional exam a year early. I graduated with extended English, Mathematics, and Computer Science, as well as the IT Technician qualification.\nCurrently, I study part-time to gain professional experience while improving my skills. In my free time, I focus on learning and building projects, such as my Investo website.\nI create full-stack applications using React, Next.js, Vite, Node.js, Express.js, and Tailwind, and work with databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and MySQL. My main languages are TypeScript and Python, but I also know the basics of PHP and C++. At this stage, my experience includes personal projects, school internships, and a website built for a company under a volunteer agreement."  },
